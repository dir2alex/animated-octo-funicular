    <h1>What Am I Looking At?</h1>

    <p>What you are looking at, is a fan made page of the Video Game "Portal" created by one guy (with the help and <br>
      support of many others) to create a love letter for Valve <br>(who is the sole creator of Portal)! This
      page is made purely for fun. And SCIENCE!</p>
